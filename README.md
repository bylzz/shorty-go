# Url Shortener built with Go

A simple URL shortener using Go and Mongo.

This project was built using [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) and offers two data stores:

* [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) - Embedded Go Key/Value Database for a simple standalone exec using 
* [Mongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver) - To handle clustered services such as in a Kubernetes environment

The Mongo database uses [go-cache](github.com/patrickmn/go-cache) to ttl cache to prevent burdening the database with redundant requests.
